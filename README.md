## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Divyanshsingh575/Chat_Assistant.git
   cd Chat_Assistant
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install flask
   ```
3. Create an SQLite database named `chat_assistant.db` and set up the required tables:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
       Name TEXT,
       Department TEXT,
       Hire_Date TEXT,
       Salary INTEGER
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE Departments (
       ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
       Name TEXT,
       Manager TEXT
   );
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
5. 🖥️ The server should start running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. 🎉

## API Usage 🔧
The `/query` endpoint accepts a JSON payload with a query string. Example request:
```json
{
    "query": "Show me all employees in the Sales department"
}
```
Example response:
```json
{
    "employees": ["Alice", "Bob"]
}
```

## Future Improvements 🌱
🧠 Add more complex query support (e.g., filtering by multiple parameters).
🤖 Improve NLP capabilities for better query understanding.
🎨 Create a frontend UI for a more interactive user experience.
